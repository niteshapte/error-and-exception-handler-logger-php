error-and-exception-logger-php
===============================

Hi guys,

I believe that everyone is well aware of errors and exceptions in PHP. And I am sure, everyone must have their own way of handling them.

But there is problem in PHP. PHP can easily trap and log runtime errors but PHP error handlers cannot trap fatal errors. 
And it makes the debugging a troublesome job. I too have faced problems. So, I decided to solve this issue. After going 
through PHP Manual for hours I found a method called register_shutdown_function()


I wrote a class ErrorLogging which catch fatal errors along with notice, warnings and exception. I published it on 
PHPClasses.org. Here is the link â€“ http://www.phpclasses.org/package/6512-PHP-Handle-PHP-fatal-and-non-fatal-execution-errors.html. 
I won first prize for this. :D (Yay!!!). This class will show you the stack-trace of errors/exceptions.

The idea:
Registers an error handler that is capable of a backtrace with the list of functions and arguments used to call the 
code that causes an error, send that information to the current page output or the PHP error log, or send an e-mail 
message to the administrator. The class can also trap fatal errors using a special PHP shutdown callback function.
